In the first file I made the 5 waves. I used multiple functions for the waves but for each wave the period is 2pi. In the second file I wanted to put the operations, but couldn't directly without changing the other code, cause I took a different time vector and frequency for the different waves. So in the second file I assembled a couple common parameters so the operations could be done.
